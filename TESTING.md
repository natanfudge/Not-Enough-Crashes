# Testing Not Enough Crashes
 This documents details how to test Not Enough Crashes after making changes.  

Apply these tests in the production environment, with the test mod:
- Fabric: `cd TestFabricMod`, Forge: `cd TestForgeMod`
- `gradlew build`
For dev use:
- Fabric: copy production jar to `run/mods/`
- Forge: copy dev jar to `run/mods/` (there is no support for automatic remapping)
